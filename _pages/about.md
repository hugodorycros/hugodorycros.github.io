I'm a final year graduate student at the TU

I am a PhD researcher in Anthropology at the Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Sociale at EHESS, Paris.

Trained in political science at Leiden University and anthropology at EHESS, I do interdisciplinary research on mining in West Africa and Latin America. I also practice photography.
